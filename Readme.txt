More than anything, these project files are a scratchpad for myself to ensure future repeatability and also to help others than stumble upon this work.
I am learning to program the STM32 and want to do it at the lowest level possible, and intend to use vim, gcc, and gdb instead of and IDE.
I am currently following https://vivonomicon.com

First, install:
  gcc-arm-none-eabi
  gdb-arm-none-eabi
  libnewlib-arm-none-eabi
  libstdc++-arm-none-eabi
