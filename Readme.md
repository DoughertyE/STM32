I am learning to program the STM32 and want to do it at the lowest level possible, and intend to use vim, gcc, and gdb instead of an IDE.
I am currently following https://vivonomicon.com but am modifying the samples to work with the STM32F446RE which uses the Cortex-M4.

First, install:
  * gcc-arm-none-eabi
  * gdb-multiarch
    * The above replaced "gdb-arm-none-eabi"
  * stlink-tools
